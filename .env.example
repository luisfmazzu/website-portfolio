# IMPORTANT NOTES ON ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN NEXT.JS
#
# 1. Server-side variables (No NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix):
#    - Can ONLY be accessed by server components and API routes
#    - Cannot be accessed by client components
#    - Are more secure as they never reach the browser
#
# 2. Client-side variables (With NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix):
#    - Can be accessed by both client and server components
#    - Are visible in the browser (not secure for API keys)
#    - Must be used for any variables needed in client components
#
# If a variable is needed in both client and server components,
# you need to define it twice (with and without the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)

# Server-side environment variables (not accessible in the browser)
